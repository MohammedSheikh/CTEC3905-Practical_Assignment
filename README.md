# Intro

The website that I am creating is a fansite for Audi cars as I am a fan myself. I will be using standards-compliant HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 code. The site will contain information about the Audi brand including history, gallery and information regarding current Audi cars.

# Usability and Information Architecture

I initially sketeched out my ideas with pen and paper to map out a layout plan of my website in all the screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop). This was just a general layout of my website theme, rather than a design of all content within the pages.

I want to make the website very easy for people to use by minimizing the cognitive load by structuring content intelligently.

I aim to support accessibility features for users with disabilities.

# Testing

I aim to have my website tested by friends/family so that I can improve it as best as possible.
