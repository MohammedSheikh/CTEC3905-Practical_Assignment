# CTEC3905-Practical_Assignment

# Intro

The website that I am creating is a fansite for Audi cars as I am a fan myself. I will be using standards-compliant HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6 code. The site will contain information about the Audi brand including history, gallery and information regarding current Audi cars.

# Design Journey

I initially sketched out my ideas with pen and paper to map out a layout plan of my website in all the screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop). This was just a general layout of my website theme, rather than a design of all content within the pages (First-Design.pdf).

I then created another design draft (Second-Design.pdf) in which I evolved the design by including more details such as social media links and navigation menus.

In my third design (Third-Design.pdf), where I was able to consolidate many ideas into one- this roughly represented my final design. I included how the search bar would pop out and how the social media icons would appear at different screen sizes. One of the things I changed from my second to third design was the position of the menu from the left hand side to the right, in mobile view. Studies show that roughly 88% of the world is left handed (source:Google), therefore I thought that since it is more likely that a right-handed person would use the website, I put the menu on the right hand side.

I also created another Wireframe on PowerPoint (Wireframe_Mobile.pptx) in which I created another neater design to complement my paper designs.

# Usability and Information Architecture

I always intended to make the website user friendly and accessible for people with certain disabilities. That is why I extensively used semantic tags throughout my website (to cater for screen readers), used 'alt' tags for all images (for the same reason), and also used ARIA features in some places. To minimze the cognitive load on users, I applied the elements strategically and made sure to not include too much information on one page.

To conform to the 'PARC' principles:

* I ensured that the colours contrasted well and were as complementary as possible. For example I used white text on black background or vice versa.
want to make the website very easy for people.

* I placed similar elements together in proximity (such as the social media icons).

* I ensured that the same colour theme was represented throughout my website to achieve good repetition.

* I made sure to align all elements properly in mobile, tablet and desktop views as much as possible.

# Testing

I used the following questionnaire on family and friends as it was designed by UX researchers. Much of the feedback was extremely positive:
